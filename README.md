# Loading Products from API in React

This ia a react project to load products from API. I am fetching the data from Dummy Json.

## How it works
The first 20 products will be loaded. On clicking the load more button, it will fetch the next 20 distinct product from the one originally displayed i.e it skipped the first loaded 20 products and fetches the next 20 products.

## Limit
There is a limit of 100. Once it fetches up to 100 products, the button will changes and inform the user that the they have reached the limit of 100 products
